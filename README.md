To launch the server insert in the command prompt the following lines:
g++ -o server server.cpp
./server

Note that you have to launch these commands from the folder where server.cpp file is located. Additionally, you must have a g++ compiler installed on your device.

For the client, repeat the same procedure replacing 'server' with 'client'.

Files server.cpp and client.cpp must be compiled in different terminal windows so that there is connection between them.
