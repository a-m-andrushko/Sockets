To launch the server insert in the command prompt the following lines:
g++ -o server server.cpp
./server

Note that you have to launch these commands from the folder where server.cpp file is located. Additionally, you must have a g++ compiler installed on your device.

For the client, repeat the same procedure replacing 'server' with 'client'.
