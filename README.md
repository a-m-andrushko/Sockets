To launch the server insert in the command prompt the following lines:

_g++ -o server server.cpp_

_./server_

Note that you have to launch these commands from the folder where _server.cpp_ file is located. Additionally, you must have a _g++_ compiler installed on your device.

For the client, repeat the same procedure replacing _'server'_ with _'client'_.

Files _server.cpp_ and _client.cpp_ must be compiled in different terminal windows so that there is connection between them.
